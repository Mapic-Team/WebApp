## Wireframe

The following wireframes were created using [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/).

![Wireframe 1](/docs/ui-design/screenshots/homewireframe.png)

The homepage of the website features a map as the primary element. At the top of the page, there is a fixed navigation bar that floats above the map. On the left side of the navigation bar, there are two tabs: "Mapic" and "Browse." On the right side of the navigation bar, there is a user avatar and a "Profile" link. In the bottom-left corner of the map, there is a button that allows users to find their current location. In addition, the map contains numerous pop-ups, which include thumbnail images of user-uploaded photos. A floating page appears above the map when a user clicks on a pop-up. This page contains a larger version of the photo, a description of the photo, and a comment box below the image. Users can use this comment box to send comments to the photo owner.

Another significant page is the user's profile. The user's profile page has a navigation bar on the left side. At the top of the navigation bar is the website's name. Below the name, there are three tabs: "Statistics," "Settings," and "Privacy." At the bottom of the navigation bar, there is a "Log Out" button. The user's personal information is displayed on the right side of the page, including their avatar, username, and unique account ID. Below the personal information, there is a description section for the user. To the right of the description, the user's most liked and commented photos are showcased, along with their locations.

Our webpage also provides a “secondary view” page, where the user can browse the pictures in completely immersive mode. Under this mode, the picture is enlarged and display on the center of the page, with links underneath the picture that allows the user to interact with the picture by checking the author’s profile, or like and comment. The side bars on each side supply auxiliary functions. On the left side, the user can look up images by tags. On the right side, the user have a list of currently trending photos they can choose to visit.

## Stories

### Story 1

As a photographer and traveler, I have been to many places, and I love posting photos on social media. In Mapic, I can simply log in, upload the photos, and select the location, then the pictures will be shown on the corresponding location on the map. When I go to the main page, which is the Map of the Pictures, every hilighted spot on the map represents a list of my photos. 

### Story 2

I am a writer. Recently, I am searching for inspiration for my new story, so I go to Mapic. Instead of usingthe Map view to browse pictures, I switch to the secondary view, which is similar to general social media website like instagram, and I select the "Trend" category. In this category, I can see the most popular photos from all over the world. When I click on a specific post, I can read the detailed description of the pictures and read more comments, and they are very helpful for new ideas.
 

### Story 3
I want to travel to a nice place during the break, and I would like some suggestions. I think Mapic is a good choice, so I registered an account. Once this step is done, I can browse the contents freely. In the secondary view, there are a lot of tags on the right-hand side, such as "Snow Mountain", "Yellow Stone". They looks interesting to me, so I dive right in! I also noticed there is a search bar at the left-hand side, I searched "National Park" and relevant results were returned. After reading many posts, I have decided where to go!

## HTML & CSS Mockup

This section contains the HTML and CSS mockup of the website. The map is based on [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

The first two pictures above demonstrate how users interacted with the map. Users can zoom in and out, and they can also click the photos on the map to view the details of the pictures. The third picture shows interface when the user clicks picture pop-ups on the map.
