## Wireframe

The following wireframes were created using [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/).

![Wireframe 1](homewireframe.png)

The homepage of the website features a map as the primary element. At the top of the page, there is a fixed navigation bar that floats above the map. On the left side of the navigation bar, there are two tabs: "Mapic" and "Browse." On the right side of the navigation bar, there is a user avatar and a "Profile" link. In the bottom-left corner of the map, there is a button that allows users to find their current location. In addition, the map contains numerous pop-ups, which include thumbnail images of user-uploaded photos. A floating page appears above the map when a user clicks on a pop-up. This page contains a larger version of the photo, a description of the photo, and a comment box below the image. Users can use this comment box to send comments to the photo owner.

Another significant page is the user's profile. The user's profile page has a navigation bar on the left side. At the top of the navigation bar is the website's name. Below the name, there are three tabs: "Statistics," "Settings," and "Privacy." At the bottom of the navigation bar, there is a "Log Out" button. The user's personal information is displayed on the right side of the page, including their avatar, username, and unique account ID. Below the personal information, there is a description section for the user. To the right of the description, the user's most liked and commented photos are showcased, along with their locations.

## Stories

### Story 1

As a photographer and traveler, I have been to many places, and I love posting photos on social media. In Mapic, I can simply log in, upload the photos, and select the location, then the pictures will be shown on the corresponding location on the map. When I go to the main page, which is the Map of the Pictures, every hilighted spot on the map represents a list of my photos. 

### Story 2

I am a writer. Recently, I am searching for inspiration for my new story, so I go to Mapic. Instead of usingthe Map view to browse pictures, I switch to the secondary view, which is similar to general social media website like instagram, and I select the "Trend" category. In this category, I can see the most popular photos from all over the world. When I click on a specific post, I can read the detailed description of the pictures and read more comments, and they are very helpful for new ideas.
 

### Story 3
I want to travel to a nice place during the break, and I would like some suggestions. I think Mapic is a good choice, so I registered an account. Once this step is done, I can browse the contents freely. In the secondary view, there are a lot of tags on the right-hand side, such as "Snow Mountain", "Yellow Stone". They looks interesting to me, so I dive right in! I also noticed there is a search bar at the left-hand side, I searched "National Park" and relevant results were returned. After reading many posts, I have decided where to go!
